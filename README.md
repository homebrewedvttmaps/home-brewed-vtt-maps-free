# Home Brewed VTT Maps - Free

This compendium module contains 6 Foundry-ready maps for you to use in 
whatever game system you're running on Foundry.

The Fey Gate maps have been implemented as a phased map utilizing DWW's 
Scene Phase module (free version), which is available 
[here](https://www.patreon.com/posts/dww-battle-map-42092783). However, 
those scenes should be useable as stand-alones without that module.

If you like these maps, please consider supporting me at my [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/homebrewedmaps).
